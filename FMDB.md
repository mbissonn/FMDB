# Fake Movie Database

## Tools

### Database: MySQL

    The relational database that the project uses is MySql, constructed using Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS). A drop-create-insert script can be found in:
    
        FMDB/Database/dropcreate.sql

    To create the database, please use SSMS and navigate to:

        File > Open > File

    Then, select and open FMDB/Database/dropcreate.sql. Finally, execute the query script. The database should now be set up and populated with 15 movies.

### General Purpose Language: C\#

    The backend is coded in C#, and has the standard controller, DAO, and model organizational scheme.

### IDE: Visual Studio Community 2019

    Visual Studio Community 2019 was used as the IDE within which the backend code was written.

### API Framework: ASP.NET

    The backend uses the ASP.NET framework as its web framework, allowing for basic API functionality.

### Frontend Framework: BootstrapVue

    The frontend was written in Visual Studio Code, and uses BootstrapVue to construct an intuitively navigable user interface.

## Next Steps

    While the site is functional, visually appealing, and feature-complete, much of the code could stand to be refined and simplified. There is a certain lack of elegance in some of the frontend logic that I would like to rectify.

    Ultimately, to achieve this, I will need to gain a better understanding of the BoostrapVue packages and components that are used in the project. Much of the code cleanup that needs to be done is a result of the how newly-acquainted I am with those tools.

    With all that in mind, I believe the most important next steps for this project are to gain a better understanding of BootstrapVue writ-large and to refactor the frontend code accordingly.
